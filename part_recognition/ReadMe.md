# Part Recognition

This (chronologically) is the second half of the project. After the picture/video of the assembly is captured and divided into parts,
the "broken" part will be cut from the picture and sent to this half for classifictaion.

Here, the image of the part will be processed and identified using a convolutional neural network largely based on the Tensorflow website's
Cifar10 CNN example (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn).
